Arcade-Style Gameplay:

Faster, exaggerated movements with less emphasis on strategy.

Boosted dunks, flashy passes, and rapid transitions for an engaging experience.

Ideal for casual players but lacks the depth of realistic decision-making.

Simulation-Based Gameplay:

Emphasizes realistic team dynamics, stamina management, and AI adjustments.

Playcalling and defensive strategies shape game outcomes.

Perfect for college basketball authenticity, where tactics matter as much as raw athleticism.

Hybrid Gameplay:

A mix of fluid arcade mechanics with realistic basketball strategies.

Allows customization of gameplay speed, physics, and AI behavior.

Best suited for users who want control over realism vs. entertainment.

For a college basketball simulation, the hybrid approach is ideal, balancing authentic playstyles while maintaining accessibility for newcomers.

Visual Design: How the Game Should Look
The presentation of a college basketball simulation should mirror a TV broadcast experience, emphasizing smooth camera transitions, lifelike player models, and accurate court details.

Camera System: Inspired by NBA 2K, the game should include:

Broadcast-style sideline and overhead cameras for a professional feel.

Player lock views enabling individual control immersion.

Auto-zoom mechanics that enhance intensity during fast breaks.

Graphics and Animation:

Polished court textures, reflecting home-court branding and NCAA-approved designs.

Customizable jerseys with accurate team colors and sponsor integration.

Realistic player movements, ensuring dribbles, shots, and defensive reactions mimic real-life execution.

TV Scorebugs and Stat Integration:

Fully customizable scorebugs resembling ESPN, FOX, CBS broadcasts.

Dynamic overlays displaying player stats, shooting percentages, and historical performances.

Halftime reports and post-game breakdowns enhancing storytelling.

Why a 5v5 Format is Essential
College basketball traditionally operates in a 5v5 format, where team cohesion and individual roles create dynamic gameplay. Implementing this format ensures:

Strategic Playcalling & Defensive Adjustments:

Teams adjust to fast breaks, zone defenses, and full-court presses based on player fatigue and momentum shifts.

Matchups become criticalâ€”balancing star players with rotational depth.

Realistic Player Fatigue & Substitutions:

Endurance affects shot accuracy, defensive response, and off-ball movement.

Coaches must manage bench rotations and play styles based on team strengths.

Authentic NCAA Tournament Atmosphere:

A 5v5 format mirrors March Madness intensity, where individual performances can change the course of a game.

Crowd engagement and pressure mechanics create immersive environments, especially during late-game moments.
